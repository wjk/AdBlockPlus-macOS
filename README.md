# AdBlockPlus for macOS Sierra

~~**Download AdBlockPlus for macOS**~~ The current release build _does not function_ with macOS Sierra Developer Preview 2 or 3. If you try to launch it, it will crash immediately upon launch. At this time you must build the application from source for it to be functional.

This repository contains a copy of [Adblock Plus for iOS](https://github.com/adblockplus/adblockplussafariios),
ported to operate correctly on the developer preview of macOS Sierra.
As with the upstream version of AdBlock, it is licensed under the
GNU General Public License, version 3.
